            <figcaption id="img-caption">Bill Evans is an American jazz pianist and composer who mostly played in trios. His use of impressionist harmony, inventive
            interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords, and trademark rhythmically independent, "singing" melodic
            lines continue to influence jazz pianists today. </figcaption>
